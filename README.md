The URLs that we'll need for our pages are:

    category/ — The home (index) page.
    category/books/ — A list of all books.
    category/authors/ — A list of all authors.
    category/book/<id> — The detail view for a particular book, with a field primary key of <id> (the default). For example, the URL for the third book added to the list will be /catalog/book/3.
    category/author/<id> — The detail view for the specific author with a primary key field of <id>.  For example, the URL for the 11th author added to the list will be  /catalog/author/11.
